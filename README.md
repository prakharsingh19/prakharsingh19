### Hi there! 👋  

I'm **@prakharsingh19**, a tech enthusiast passionate about exploring the intersections of **ECE**, **IT**, **CS**, and **Data Science**. Driven by curiosity, I dive deep into understanding the “how” and “why” of things, always eager to explore every detail, both pros and cons!  

#### 🌟 Highlights  
- Successfully **cleared the Intelligence Officer Examination** and interviewed with the **Intelligence Bureau of India**.  
- Cleared **SSB** (Service Selection Board) and qualified **GATE CSE 2024**, showcasing strong analytical and technical expertise.

Math (especially **calculus**) and **soft skills** aren’t my strongest suits, but I’m always working on improving.
